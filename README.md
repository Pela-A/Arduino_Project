# Arduino_Project
Project exploring use of Arduino boards.

## How to get started
I bought an Arduino Uno R3 board starter kit from Elegoo off of Amazon.

Once you receive the package, plug in the main board via USB to your desktop. Install Arduino IDE, install drivers etc.

I would read up on how the wiring works. There's actual like Electrical Engineering fundamentals like understanding voltages, grounds, resistors etc.

From here you need to decide what you want to do. 

## My project
After doing some tutorials I decided to make a single digit seven segment display that could be incremented or decremented.

Link to wiring I copied for setting up the seven segment display: https://projecthub.arduino.cc/stannano/one-digit-7-segment-led-display-819bcd

I personally wired the buttons since it's pretty simple for buttons (IO)
## Coding


void SetUp(){
Function that instantiates values etc. Runs once on start
}

void loop(){
Function that continously runs. Here is where you check for logic like if a button was pressed etc
}

There should be a bunch of guides to look at as well if you go here and download
